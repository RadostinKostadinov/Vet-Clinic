# Vet-Clinic
This is a web application to manage the examinations in a veterinary clinic.


For every pet can be booked a hour for examination, also when a user books a hour he can pass an additional information (what should be examined, pet sex, pet years, pet name, preffered doctor etc..). <br>
Bookings are displayed in a calendar like Google Calendar.

User Roles:
Employee

To use the app, the employee should have a profile, which for now can be created only directly from the database.
